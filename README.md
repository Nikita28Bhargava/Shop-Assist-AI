# Laptop-Recommendation-AI
This is an LLM project for assisting user in selecting laptop as per their need

# Objective:
The primary objective of the Shop Assist AI Project is to provide personalized laptop recommendations to the users. The system aims to understand user preferences and suggest laptop that align with their tastes.

# Design:
The model is designed using the following stages and different functions present in different stages.

Stage 1: Intent Clarity and Intent Confirmation Layer This layer helps in identifying the userâ€™s requirements and passing it on the product mapping layer.

Stage 2: Product Mapping and Information Extraction Layer In this layer we take the output of the previous layer/stage, that is, user requirements , which is in the form of a python dictionary. Next we will extract the top 3 laptops as per the need.

Stage 3: Product Recommendation Layer Finally we come to the product recommendation layer.

We then combine all the stages defined above. Stage 1 + Stage 2 + Stage 3 We create a dialogue_mgmt_system() function that contains the logic of how the different layers would interact.

# Implementation:
Technologies used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Pandas, Openai, os, json, ast
API: IMDb
Open AI Model Used: gpt-3.5-turbo

# Challenges:
Following challenges were faced during the creation of the model.

1. Data Quality and Availability: Ensuring the availability and accuracy of the movie data from external sources was a challenge. Handling inconsistencies and missing data was another.
2. Personalization: Balancing the need for personalized recommendations with user privacy. Implementing secure data handling and storage practices.

# Lessons Learned:
Following lessons were learned as part of this project.

1. User Centric Design: Importance of understanding user behavior and preferences to provide relevant recommendations. Continuous user feedback is crucial for improving recommendation accuracy.
2. Iterative Development: Adopting an iterative approach to model training and system improvement. Regularly updating the model with new data to maintain relevance.
3. Performance Optimization: Necessity of optimizing algorithms for real time performance
